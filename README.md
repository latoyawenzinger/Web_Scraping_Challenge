# Web_Scraping_Challenge


Browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup was used to scrape information from 2 sites: 

1. **Mars News**: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html

      - This site included Mars news articles
      - Titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted


2. **Mars Temperature Data**: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html


      - This site included a HTML table holding Mars weather date
      - The table was scraped to answer the following questions:


         * How many months exist on Mars?
         * How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
         * What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
         * Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
         * About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
